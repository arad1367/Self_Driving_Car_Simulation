# Self-Driving Car Simulation

Welcome to the Self-Driving Car Simulation repository! This project aims to provide a personalized self-driving car simulation using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) and Pygame.

## Overview

This project builds upon the NEAT algorithm for neural network evolution, creating a real-time visualization with Pygame for an immersive simulation experience. 
It features enhanced obstacle avoidance and efficient pathfinding algorithms, ensuring dynamic and engaging interactions.
ðŸš—ðŸ’¡ Excited to share my latest project update: I've added a brand new feature to self-driving car simulation using NEAT and Pygame! 
Now, you can save the frame-by-frame movements of the cars and seamlessly compile them into a consistent video using Clideo Ltd.! ðŸŽ¥ðŸ”§
Taking inspiration from Cheesy AI's tutorials and building upon Florian Dedov's code, I've crafted another version of the self-driving car simulation.

## Features

- Utilizes NEAT algorithm for neural network evolution.
- Real-time visualization with Pygame.
- Enhanced obstacle avoidance and pathfinding algorithms.
- Randomized obstacle positions for a unique experience with each run.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/arad1367/Self_Driving_Car_Simulation.git`


2. Install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. Run the simulation:
`python main.py`


4. Enjoy exploring the simulation!
